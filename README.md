I'm an undergrad student studying Electronics & Instrumentation Engineering at BITS Pilani. I'm interested in Tech and Startups. Within Software development, I have experience building web apps, ML tools, APIs as well as some childish games. This year started off as me being a complete beginner but now I'm enroute to a gain some mastery over software development. Currently I aspire to be a part of Gsoc to learn about open source and contribute+learn in the way. So I'm checking out first timers contribs to make in the moment. More updates will follow later.
